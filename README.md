# Password Generator

This project is a password generator built using React and Vite. It generates secure, random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length, inclusion of special characters, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase letters.

## Project Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.
